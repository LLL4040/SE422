The storage scheme is generally **one NAND Flash chip** plus one low power consumption. **DRAM or Mobile RAM**. Its main application areas are handheld smart terminal devices such as **mobile phones**.##### Features:Because it is packaged together, it can effectively reduce external interference, enhance the communication capability between the NAND Flash memory chip and DEAM, and improve the overall performance of the chip. Small size and low cost. In addition, the MCP package can save 70% space compared to 2 TSOPs, saving an average of 30%-40% board space for the final product. The MCP product not only saves board space, but also simplifies the manufacturing process and saves the original. It shortens the development time of new terminal products and speeds up the launch of the terminal products.##### Application areas:Smartphone, feature phone, etc.#### 2.eMMCIt is **a package of Flash control IC and NAND Flash**. This solution is better than NAND flash alone and has better compatibility. eMMC's embedded memory standard specification for the JEDEC Association has the advantage of simplifying memory design. The package uses a multi-chip package (MCP) technology to package the control IC and NAND Flash into a single component.##### advantage:eMMC combines data storage and replaces the NOR Flash support system boot function, which is widely used in smart phones, tablets, smart boxes, smart TVs and other products.##### Application areas:**Tablets**, **smartphones**, etc.#### 3.eMCPIt is based on MCP products. The storage solution is **an eMMC chip plus a low-power DRAM or Mobile RAM**.##### advantage:Compared with the traditional MCP, eMCP can reduce the burden of the main chip operation and manage the larger capacity of the flash memory because of **the built-in NAND Flash control chip**. In terms of external design, whether it is eMCP or eMMC The embedded memory design concept is to make the smart phone's exterior thinner and the cabinet more complete.##### Application areas:Tablet, smartphone.### Performance#### 1.Speed * The speed of the memory stick is generally used as the performance index when **the data is accessed once** (the unit is generally used in ns). The shorter the time, the faster the speed. Ordinary memory speed can only reach 70ns ~ 80ns, EDO memory speed can reach 60ns, and SDRAM memory speed has reached 7ns.  * Note: There are many manufacturers of memory modules. At present, there is no uniform labeling specification. Therefore, the memory performance indicators cannot be read out from the memory chip labels, but you can understand the speed, such as -70 or -60. The number indicates that the speed of this memory chip is 70ns or 60ns.#### 2. Capacity * There are various specifications for the size of the memory module. The early 30-line memory modules have 256K, 1M, 4M, and 8M capacities. The 72-line EDO memory is mostly 4M, 8M, and 16M, while the 168-line SDRAM memory is mostly 16M. , 32M, 64M, 128MB capacity, and even higher. #### 3.CAS * The CAS wait time refers to the period from when the read command is valid (issued on the rising edge of the clock) to when the output can provide data. It is usually 2 or 3 clock cycles, which determines the performance of the memory at the same operating frequency. The chip with a CAS latency of 2 is faster and performs better than a chip with a CAS latency of 3.#### 4.GUF * vThe higher frequency given by the manufacturer is lowered some, and the value thus obtained is called the rated available frequency GUF. For a memory bank of 8 ns, the highest usable frequency is 125 MHz, then the rated available frequency (GUF) should be 112 MHz. The highest available frequency and the rated available frequency (front-end system bus operating frequency) maintain a certain margin to maximize the stability of the system.### How to chooseAnd when we choose, how big is it? One of the most important decision parameters is the maximum amount of memory supported by the CPU and the motherboard. Some CPUs and motherboards support 32G of memory, and more than 32G of memory is wasted, which is superfluous.First, let's look at the speed of our own memory stick. If it is DDR4 or 2400MHz, then the memory stick you add is best at the same rate. A memory stick below 2400MHz will pull down the overall speed, even if you add a 16G size, it will not help. Similarly, buy a memory stick higher than 2400MHz, the operating state will be pulled down to 2400MHz.The first is the maximum capacity that the CPU and the motherboard can support; the second is the reasonable matching of the card slot, the performance of the whole machine should be balanced; the last is to see the parameters of the computer memory, the same type of frequency is the best, too High and low will have an impact on the computer. Therefore, when we buy, don't be deceived by the merchants. The bigger the better, the only one that is most suitable for your computer is the one you choose.
